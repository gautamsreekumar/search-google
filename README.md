Python script to Google search from Ubuntu command line
-------------------------------------------------------

This is program is written and is to be copied to /usr/bin/ in your Ubuntu system under any name you like. I have named the command google which seemed sensible.

The command for this is:

sudo cp ./myCommand.py /usr/bin/<your-command>

Run this command from the directory where this file named myCommand.py is present.

Usage:

run the below command anywhere in the command line, if you have named the command google

google <your-search-query-here>

Example : 
google facebook log in page
google theuselessweb website
